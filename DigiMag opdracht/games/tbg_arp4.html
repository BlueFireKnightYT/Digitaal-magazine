        <!--the story of the game-->
        <p>
            You look at the angry bus driver that starts losing patient. <br>
            Since he said that he won't get paid for getting to the city do you have something in mind to do with that <br>
            You want to go to the city but walking isn't a option you need to scam this dude <br>
            So you said: "well i can pay you much more as you want, i won't tell it to your boss"<br>
            The bus driver looked at you with a questionable look on his face <br>
            "Do you really want to pay me? just so you don't have to walk to the city? i mean the city only 200 miles from here but if you really want this i can't stop you" <br>
            <br>
            The bus driver take you to the city <br>
            In the window you saw the landscape changing from woods to more city like buildings. <br>
            But somethings off.. you don't see any cars and dancity but fog only.. <br>
            You start to have an weird feeling about your choice, that there's something wrong with this city 
            Very, very wrong... <br>
            You try to walk out of the bus but the bus kept the door closed <br>
            "We're now at the city, before you go.. can i get paid?" <br>
            You walked up to the bus driver and tell him that you rather want to that after you return to the same bus station. <br>
            The bus driver agrees with you but also ask you for a phific time when you return to the bus station, so he can go towards it around that time <br>
            <br>
            After you told him the time opens the bus driver the door. <br>
            You walked out of the bus and looked around you while the bus drives away... <br>
            The city looks so empty... no big crowd no cars, Nothing.. but fog <br>
            You're thinking to find your uncle and ask him what happend, But you also want to find out what happend to your friends <br>
