        <!--the story of the game-->
        <p>
            You get out of the bus and walk towards the city... <br>
            There's no car on the highway towards the city, It looks like your entering a ghost town. <br>
            Fog is starting to form when you get closer to the city. <br>
            You have a bad feeling about the choice that you made... <br>
            The city wasn't like this.. Never! it always was heavly crowded <br>
            But this time.. Nothing.. <br>  
            You want to go and ask your uncle for help, because he always know what to do in these situations <br>
            On the other hand, you want to find your friends
