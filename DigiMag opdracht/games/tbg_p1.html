            and reconcidering life choices. <br>
            You're bored and want to do something <br>
            So you stand up, and walked towards your phone that lays on the desk <br>
            You stare at your phone that has been laying on the desk since your lost of someone close<br>
            There's nothing really specail on there <br>
            Only just a message app and a weird app
        </p>
