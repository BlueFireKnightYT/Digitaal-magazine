            You pick up your phone and start the weird app on your phone. <br>
            It looks like it has only one thing... <br>
            And that's a sort of soundboard, but besides the sound board you can also print the emoij's of the soundboard. <br>
            You see different type of animale emoij's like: A bee, pig, cow, a dog, and a lizzard. <br>
            You look at the lizzard emoij and think: "i've been going through alot of shit the last year so, why not?" <br>
            So you press on the lizzard emoij. <br>
            And you hear a robotic voice saying: L I Z Z A R D. <br>
            And a lizzard emoij apears on your screen. <br>
            Your goals of today has completely changed, Your goal is now to get 150 million lizzard emoij's. <br>
            So you start spamming them
