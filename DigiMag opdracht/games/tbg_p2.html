        <p>
            You opend your phone and check for some new message. <br>
            Well... <br>
            There are no new messages
            So you just read the old messages from family and friends <br>
            The last time that you spoke with them was 5 yeas ago 
            Did they forget your existence? <br>
            Or did something happend to them? <br>
            You really want to know why nobody talked to you in the last tough 5 years of greefing... <br>
            But on the other hand, its better to just lay on bed for the rest of your life <br> 
        </p>
