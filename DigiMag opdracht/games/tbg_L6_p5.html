        <p>
            You try to open the door.. But with no success <br>
            You spotted an crowbar at the left side of your eyes, and picked it up <br>
            At the door you used the crowbar to open the door and head inside of the appartment. <br>
            You walked towards the door form the living room and opened it <br>
            As you walked into the living room you see that your uncle's appartment is an mess. <br>
            On the ground you found shivers of glass. <br>
            It looks like the appartment is abandoned for over a decade <br>
