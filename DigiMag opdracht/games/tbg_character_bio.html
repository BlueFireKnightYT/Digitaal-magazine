               You are someone that recently lost someone too close to you <br>
               And you've been depressed ever since it happend. <br>
               You also recently moved out from the big city to a village<br>
               It was hard for you to leave your home town because, your friends and family are there! <br>
               Hopefully can you visit them once again. <br>
               Since your depression you can't stop staring at your bedrooms sealing and greef. <br>
               You're also thinking to end it all, and just give it up on life <br>
               <br>
               Since an short period you've been feeling better but it's still isn't far from good <br>
               Somehow you also can't take control over your choices. <br>
               It feels like your'e getting controlled by some kind of unknown force that picks whatever it thinks <br>
