             Chapter one: It all starts with...
        </h2>

        <!--the story of the game-->
        <p>
            You got the idea to start looking for your friends. <br>
            But you don't know exactly where they are.. i mean they could be anywhere <br>
            Like for example at: StarRubles, the mall or at the hospital. <br>
            So you start where every single clear minded person would go: they're home <br>
            <br>
            You arrived at one of your friend's home location, It just took you 45 minutes because GaGaMaps had a way longer route because it thought somehow that there was traffic <br>
            You heard the wind and nothing more... <br>
            It feels so alienation to you that a city what was once filled with people, has now turned into a ghost town. <br>
            You walked up to the window and try to see into the living room. <br>
            But the windows where somehow sealed off.. So you desides to go to the door <br> 
        </p>
