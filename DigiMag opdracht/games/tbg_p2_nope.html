         <!--the story of the game-->
          <p>
            You want to go to bed... <br>
            But after seeing that you've been laying there for over 5 years. <br>
            You find it abit weird to do that again, and rot away. <br>
            So you want to try to move on, and you're going to be your old self again <br>
            Since, you've in mind to check out what's up with your friends and family because they haven't been spoken to be ever since. <br>

          </p>
