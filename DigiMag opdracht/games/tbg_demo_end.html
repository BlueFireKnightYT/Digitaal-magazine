        <p>
            Thank you so much for playing this demo! <br>
            Don't worry the full game will come soon whenever the project: text based game is! <br>
            for now you can go back and try to get the different endings. <br>
            Do you have every ending? <br>
            Good! because than you really enjoyed this game! <br>
            this game isn't based on a true story or somehting <br>
            It's just based on my imagination and abit of silent hill <br>
            For the record: i've never played or watched sillent hill gameplay. I only watched the recent gameplay of it <br>
            So this is my interpitation of the game! <br>
    
    
        </p>
