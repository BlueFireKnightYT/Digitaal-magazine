            <p>
                I wake up infront of a appartment building... <br>
                It's my uncle's! <br>
                But why am i here? last think i remeber was that i lay down on my bed... <br>
                And just staring at the celing.. <br>
                I look around me and saw that i was in the city where i used to live.. <br>
                But it looks different.. it's empty and foggy.. <br>
                I headed back down stairs and walked on the empty streetways 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After a while i saw something in the distance... <br>
                It looks like a bus at a bus station??? that's weird because this city is good as abandoned. <br>
                I head towards the bus station and saw that the bus has no one in it besides the bus driver <br>
                When i was inside the bus i got greeted by the bus driver, as i sit down the bus driver closes his doors and started driving <br>
                "where are we going actually?" did tell to the bus driver. "we're going back to the town," <br>
                After a while the bus driver stopped the bus at the nearest bus station and opens the doors. <br>
                When i wanted to leave i got hold up by the bus driver <br>
                He ask me to pay 50.000, i found that weird and ask him why <br>
                "what you mean IM SORRY WHAT?! you promise me to pay extra so i can bring you to the city." <br>
                I still don't understand what he ment because i never went there, so i told him that my last memories where that i lay down on my bed <br>
                And staring at the ceeling. <br>
                Wich he responded with: "yeah, yeah i believe you, and now GET OUT! " <br>
                I walked out of the bus and i could hear him saying that he can't believe it that he got scammend <br>
                I don't understand what happend because i never should EVER have did that! <br>
                So i head back to home and try to vigure out what happend.. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    I got a weird feeling that i was controlled by something or someone without even knowing it<br>
                    I mean the last thing i know was that i did nothing but laying down in my bed <br>
                    And after at least 2 seconds i found myself in front of my uncle's appartment <br>
                    The only thing what i can think of is that i might be possesd by something with that power <br>
                </p>
